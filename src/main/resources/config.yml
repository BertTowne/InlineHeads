# You should only change this if your server already has a default resource pack.
# In that case, you MUST FIRST manually add the "Pixelized" resource pack below
# into your own resource pack, and then change the url and hash to that of the
# resulting resource pack. I recommend hosting the resource pack at
# https://mc-packs.net for ease of use.

  enabled: true   # Set to false only if you wish to send the resource pack through another plugin, such as ForcePack.
